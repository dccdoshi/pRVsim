# pRVsim

**pRVsim** is a Python package for generating synthetic precision radial velocity (pRV) observations for a given star, instrument, and planetary system. It operates in a 2D spectral (2DS) format, where each spectrograph order is simulated independently.

This tool is useful for simulating the effect of stellar and planetary RV signals, understanding interpolation and BERV handling, and testing design parameters for instruments and observations.

## Features

- Generate synthetic stellar spectra at high sampling resolution
- Define instruments and spectrograph orders
- Inject planetary RV curves and compute BERV
- Apply Doppler shifts and simulate photon noise using a per-km/s SNR
- Flexible template construction from individual observations
- Modular structure for testing different configurations

## Instrument Support

Currently, only **SPIRou** and **NIRPS** are supported with actual wavelength sampling data. However, users can also define hypothetical instruments by specifying a constant sampling resolution (e.g., uniform spacing in velocity per pixel). This enables broader testing and flexibility for new or theoretical designs.

## Noise Model

At this stage, the simulation only includes **photon noise**. Other sources of noise such as instrumental systematics, tellurics, or stellar activity are **not yet implemented**. This makes pRVsim ideal for isolating and understanding the limits imposed purely by photon statistics.

## How to Use

There are two main ways to use **pRVsim**:

### 1. Interactive use with Jupyter notebooks

To explore the code on a per-order basis, use the Jupyter notebook located in the `test/` folder:

- `test/tutorial.ipynb`

This notebook allows you to:
- Define a high-resolution stellar spectrum
- Choose an instrument and order to define the wavelength range
- Set the desired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in terms of counts per 1 km/s
- Simulate photon noise and create templates
- Doppler shift observations and correct for BERV

**Note on SNR:** The SNR value refers to the flux counts for 1 km/s. For example, if your detector has 500 m/s pixels and you want ~10,000 photon counts per pixel, you should input an SNR of around 140.

### 2. Full experiment mode using the command line

For running a full simulation across all desired orders and generating output data files, use the following two scripts:

#### Step 1: Create your parameter file using the JSON creator.

```bash
python json_creator2.py --param your_json_file.json
```

#### Step 2: Run the experiment.

```bash
python run_experiment.py --param your_json_file.json --output your_results_file.df
```

This will simulate the full RV experiment using your defined setup and save the results to a DataFrame file.

## RV Curve Details

Currently, the RV curve is generated by providing:
- A date range
- The number of desired observations
- The RV semi-amplitude (K) of the planetary system

Observation dates are randomized within your given range. The barycentric Earth radial velocity (BERV) is computed for each date. You can also modify Earth-based observational parameters such as observatory longitude and latitude.

At present, the planetary RV curve assumes a **circular orbit** with a fixed **orbital frequency of 0.08**. Future versions will allow for:
- Predefined sets of observation dates
- Arbitrary orbital configurations, including eccentric or multi-planet systems
